# Introduction

## What is Photon

Photon is a syntax highlighter as a service created by and for developers. Photon transforms snippets in a **fast**, **powerful** and **very customizable** way.

It works on any platform, either using our official libraries or making calls to the [API](https://photon.sh/docs/getting-started/api-reference).

Its personalization is based on three pillars:

* Ability to process a long list of **programming languages**, **markup languages**, **text formats** and others.
* Uses a **plugins** system to improve the visual appearance and expressiveness of the snippets.
* Beautifies the visual aspect using **themes**, both selected by us and created by you.
