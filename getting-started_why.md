# Why

## Power

Unlike other syntax highlighters, Photon works on any platform, both browser-side and server-side.

Alternatives that run on the browser do not work optimally. This is because of the technical difficulties involved in understanding as many languages and taking up as little space as possible. Over time, as languages add new features, these syntax highlighters face new challenges that are sometimes impossible to solve.

Photon uses **powerful code parsers** that understand the language used to be able to highlight the snippet accurately.

Also due to this accuracy you can create/modify themes to have **total control** over the color of each element.

## Ownership

Do you remember the times when people used to upload their pages to [Geocities](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities){target="_blank"}?

Do you remember [Google Code](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html){target="_blank"}?

Whatever the response, you may be trying to save your favorite [vines](https://medium.com/@vine/important-news-about-vine-909c5f4ae7a7){target="_blank"} due to the closure of the Platform (if you're still on time).

Not to mention Twitter whose future does not look very good.

Much of the content on the internet ends up disappearing when the platforms that host it disappear.

That is why in Photon **we want you to be the owner of your content**. Your snippets **will not disappear** from our service because we do not store anything. You will not have to migrate anything in the future. **You control your snippets and their destiny**.

## Semantics

We try to make our service use web standards as accurately as possible, making use of best practices.

For example, we use the HTML `<figure>` ([link](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-figure-element){target="_blank"}) element to wrap the snippet, as indicated by the [HTML standard](https://developers.whatwg.org/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element){target="_blank"}. We also use the HTML `<code>` ([link](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-code-element){target="_blank"}) and `<samp>` ([link](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-samp-element){target="_blank"}) elements to differenciate the input (code) from the output (sample).

Other HTML elements and CSS selectors have been carefully selected to promote the **correct markup** on the web.
